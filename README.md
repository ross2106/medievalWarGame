Users are presented with a breakdown of each of the main pages.

### Home Base
Users are presented with an interactive 'lobby'. Users can click on the 'map' to move their character round whilst talking in the chat and socialising with other players. 

This page is where players will gather their resources by clicking on the different resource buttons. When the buttons are pressed, the players 'villagers' will go off to find the resources. They might not always return with something so you'll need to be patient!

### Armoury
Once users have gathered resources, they will be able to buy troops from the armoury. Each type of troop has a certain attack score which will help them gain an advantage over their opponents. Each type of unit comes at a different cost so you will need to choose wisely.

### Go into Battle
This page will allow users to battle other players! Each time you battle an opponent you are playing a game of chance. Different factors come into consideration here such as the troops you have and also your level.

You can level up by winning battles against your opponents. Each time you level up, your attack strength improves. But beware, one wrong roll of the dice will wipe out your army and send you back to square one. Check out the highest ranked players on the leaderboard.
